# Most Frequent Numbers

## Overview

The programs in this project are possible solutions to a problem where you are given an integer array 'nums' and integer 'k' and you are to return the k most frequent elements from nums.

The results may be returned in any order.

See [problem.txt](https://github.com/deverl/frequent_numbers/blob/main/problem.txt) for some sample data and the expected results.

There are probably many ways this problem could be solved. These are just some examples.

## Caveats

None of these solutions take special care to handle these situations:
- Where there are multiple input elements with the same frequency. There is no guarantee on the output in this case.
- Where there are fewer values in nums than requested by the value of k
